        <p>Dr. Turner is a Technical Leader at Kitware, Inc. where he has been employed since May of 2006. At Kitware, Wes is responsible for technical contributions to and management of projects in the Medical Imaging group. Most of Dr. Turnerâ€™s efforts revolve around the exploitation of CT and MRI patient scans, although, recent efforts have also included microscopy and bioinformatics. His most recent activities include: volumetric segmentation of brain and lung lesions; deformable registration of the brain; statistical analysis of shape; bone suppression in dual energy CT scans; tools for bioinformatics analysis; and characterization of microscope fluoroscopy images.</p>

<p>Dr. Turner received his B.S. in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in 1985, his M.S. in Computer Science from The Pennsylvania State University in 1993 and his Ph.D. in Computer Science from RPI in 2000. His research while at RPI was focused on iterative preconditioning strategies for the efficient solution of large, sparse linear systems typically arising from the finite element method applied to the solution of partial differential equations over a spatial domain. Generic C++ algorithms and high performance computing platforms were key elements of this research.</p>

<p>After completing his Ph.D., Dr. Turner joined the Visualization and Computer Vision Group at GE Global Research Center (GRC), where he contributed to a number of projects including a data fusion and virtual environment project under contract to Lockheed Martin and a forensic facial reconstruction project under contract to the FBI. His later work at GRC focused on Computer Aided Detection (CAD) algorithms for the early detection of cancerous lesions.</p>
